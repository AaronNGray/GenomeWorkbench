/// Note about the "buf_size" parameter for streams in this API.
///
/// CRWStream implementation is targeted at minimizing in-memory data copy
/// operations associated with I/O for intermediate buffering.  For that, the
/// following policies apply:
///
/// 1.  No read operation from the input device shall request less than the
///     internal stream buffer size.  In cases when the user code requests more
///     than the internal stream buffer size, the request may be passed through
///     to the input device to read directly into the buffer provided by user.
///     In that case, the read request can only be larger than the the size of
///     the internal stream buffer.
///
/// 2.  Write operations to the output device are done in full buffers, unless:
///  a. An incoming user write request is larger than the internal buffer,
///     then the contents of the internal buffer gets flushed first (which may
///     comprise of fewer bytes than the size of the internal buffer) followed
///     by a direct write request of the user's block (larger than the internal
///     stream buffer);
///  b. Flushing of the internal buffer (including 2a above) resulted in a
///     short write to the device (fewer bytes actually written).  Then, the
///     successive write attempt may contain fewer bytes than the size of the
///     internal stream buffer (namely, the remainder of what has been left
///     behind by the preceding [short] write).  This case also applies when
///     the flushing is done internally in a tied stream prior to reading.
///
/// However, any portable implementation should *not* rely on how data chunks
/// are being flushed or requested by the stream implementations.  If further
/// factoring into blocks (e.g. specially-sized) is necessary for the I/O
/// device to operate correctly, that should be implemented at the level of
/// the respective IReader/IWriter API explicitly.


/// Reader-based input stream.
/// @sa IReader
/// @attention
///     The underlying IReader is expected to block in Read() if unable to
///     extract at least one byte from the input device.  If unable to read
///     anything, it must never return eRW_Success.  In order for applications
///     to be able to use istream::readsome() (or CStreamUtils::Readsome()) on
///     CRstream, the underlying IReader must fully implement the
///     PendingCount() method.
/// @warning
///     The eRW_Error return code from any method of the underlying IReader is
///     converted to an exception thrown.  That would make the stream to catch
///     it, and to set ios_base::badbit (ios_base::bad() returns true), then
///     perhaps to re-throw the exception (if so allowed by the stream).  Note
///     that accessing streambuf's methods directly won't shield from throwing
///     the exception, so it will always be delivered to user's code.
///
/// @param buf_size
///     specifies the number of bytes for internal I/O buffer, entirely used
///     for reading by the underlying stream buffer object CRWStreambuf;
///     0 causes to create a buffer of some default size.
///
/// @param buf
///     may specify the buffer location (if 0, an internal storage gets
///     allocated and later freed upon stream destruction).
///
/// @param stm_flags
///     controls whether IReader is destroyed upon stream destruction,
///     whether exceptions get logged (or leaked, or caught silently), etc.
///
/// Special case of "buf_size" == 1 creates an unbuffered stream ("buf", if
/// provided, is still used internally as a one-char un-get location).
