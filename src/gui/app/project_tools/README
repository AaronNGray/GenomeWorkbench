gbproject
---------


Arguments:
    -i          Filename for the input Gbench project file.
    -o          Filename for the output Gbench project file.

    All actions that modify a project file read in a -i project file, and
    write the changes out to the -o project file.

    -list       Prints out a listing of the contents of the -i Gbench project
                file
    -create     Creates an empty Gbench project to the -o file.
    -title      The title to use on the -create'ed project file.
    -add        Reads in the -i Gbench project file, adds the given file, and 
                writes them new Gbench project file out to the -o file.
    -fmt        The format of the file being added with -add.
    -proj-folder    The folder to add the -add'ed file to. 
    -add-folder Adds an empty folder to the -i Gbench project folder, and
                writes it out to the -o file.
    -rm         The label of an object to remove from the project.
    -rmdir      The label of a folder in to remove from the project. Removes
                all objects and folders that are below that folder. 

    -expand     Directory to write the -i Gbench project file's contents out to
                Recreates the structure of the Gbench project file out as
                directorys and seperate files.
    -expand-fmt Format to expand Gbench project file parts out in. 
                Defaults to asn binary, other options are asnt, xml, and gtf.
                (GTF format uses GTF for seq-ids and seq-annots. XML for 
                 anything else.)
    -collapse   Reads in all files under this directory, and writes them
                into a combined Gbench project file to the -o file. 



Usage:

    Create a new project file:

        ./gbproject -o <project-file-name> -create


    Import items into a new project file:

        ./gbproject -i <project-file-name> -add <files to add>


    Create a Genome Workbench project file by importing the contents of a
    directory.  This will create a series of folders in the project file,
    mapping to the directory structure created under the import directory.

        ./gbproject -o <project-file-name> -collapse <directory>


    Split all of the parts of a project file out to seperate files, in 
    ASN Binary format

        ./gbproject  -i Y.gbp  -expand project-parts/

  
    Split all of the parts of a project file out to seperate files, in 
    GTF format
        ./gbproject  -i Y.gbp  -expand project-parts/  -expand-fmt gtf
