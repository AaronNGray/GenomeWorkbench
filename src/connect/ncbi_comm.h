/** FWDaemon request / reply.
 *  Assumed packed, all intergal fields are in network byte order.
 *
 *  A client (identified by its IP in the "origin" field, or "0" for current
 *  host, or "-1" for unknown host) requests to connect to "host:port", and to
 *  send an optional (when non-zero) "ticket" as the very first data in that
 *  connection.
 *  The client may also (optionally) identify the connection with a variable
 *  size "text" (like a service name) that must be '\0'-terminated unless it
 *  extends to the maximal request size, FWD_RR_MAX_SIZE.  In case if no such
 *  information can or should be provided, the request may skip transmitting
 *  the "text" field altogether, or can put a single '\0' in that field.
 *  @note that in order to be processed correctly, if the "text" field is to be
 *  sent, it _must_ be sent in a single transaction (syscall) with the rest of
 *  the request.
 *  Bit 0 (FWD_RR_FIREWALL, if set) of the FWDaemon control ("flag") is used to
 *  indicate that the client is a true firewall client.  If the bit is clear,
 *  it means that the client is a relay client (and hence, should use a
 *  secondary, _not an official firewall_, port of the daemon, if available).
 *
 *  In a successful reply, FWDaemon sends back a "host:port" pair for the
 *  client to re-connect to, and to send a new (non-zero) "ticket" as the very
 *  first data of that connection, so that the client can reach the endpoint
 *  requested.  If FWD_RR_KEEPALIVE was requested in "flag", the "ticket" can
 *  be returned as 0 to indicate that the client _must_ keep reusing the
 *  existing connection to that FWDaemon in order to talk to the endpoint.
 *  FWDaemon identifies itself in the "origin" field.
 *  Non-zero bit 0 in "flag" of a successful reply indicates that the true
 *  firewall mode (via DMZ) is available (acknowledged when requested), and is
 *  being used by FWDaemon.  The "text" field contains no useful information
 *  (it may not present at all if the "ticket" returned non-zero, i.e. the
 *  re-connect is required;  otherwise, it is always '\0'-terminated unless it
 *  extends to the maximal reply size, FWD_RR_MAX_SIZE).
 *
 *  An error is signified by either a short reply (shorter than up to "text" --
 *  have to be discarded, and not considered to have any valid fields), or by
 *  "port" returned 0, or by the "flag" field testing non-zero with the
 *  FWD_RR_ERRORMASK mask.  In the latter two cases of a full (i.e. not
 *  short) failure reply received:
 *  1. If "flag" does not have any bits set within FWD_RR_ERRORMASK, then:
 *      if "flag" has some bits set in FWD_RR_REJECTMASK, then the client was
 *      "rejected";  otherwise, the error is "unknown" (the "text" field, if
 *      received and non-empty, may contain an optional error message in either
 *      of these cases);
 *  2. If "flag" has some bits set within FWD_RR_ERRORMASK, then:
 *      if first 4 bytes of the reply contain "NCBI", then the entire reply is
 *      an error message (up to FWD_RR_MAX_SIZE or '\0', whichever comes first)
 *      and all the remaining fields of the reply should be considered invalid;
 *      else if the "text" field is present and non-empty, then it contains an
 *      error message;  otherwise, the error is "unspecified".
